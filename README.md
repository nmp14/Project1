# Budgegrub
An app to help you list budget as well as find restaurants suitable for your price range!
Simply enter your monthly net income and current location (or a location you may wish to move to).
You will be provided an expense form that will allow you to add an expense to a list that will be deducted from your budget.
At any time after you provide an income and location, you can request a list of a few restaurants near that location. 

# Technologies Used
Bootstrap 4.5
Anime Js 2.0
Jquery 3.5
Css
Font Awesome

# Concept
BUDGETGRUBS provides an interface to enter your monthly budget & expenses to retrieve places to eat within your monthly budget.

# Criteria 
App will ask user to create a user name and password.
It will store that data in local storage and ask the user if
they're a returning user by giving the user the option of login in,
or registering.
Once registered, upon submitting the password it will direct you to 
an input form that asks for monthly income and location.

# Motivation
Who doesn't like to eat? Food is not only about survival but also is enjoyable and during these challenging times, we wanted to provide an effective way to locate restaurants that will not break your budget bank!

# User Story
As a new or returning user, I want to be able to make a new profile or select an old one from localStorage.
When I select/make a profile, I will see 2 forms. 1 for monthly income and location (required) and 1 for entering an expense.
When I enter my monthly income and location it will be displayed somewhere on the page as a budget.
When I enter an expense it will take at least the name of the expense and the amount
When I submit the expense it will append it to a list of expenses and subtract the sum of all the expenses from your monthly budget.
When an expense is added to the list, It will have an X button on the side
If the expense is variable, you may delete with the trash icon/x button.
Once all expenses are entered, user will be left with the remaining balance.
At this point user will press "get restaurants" button and dinig opinions,
based on budget will be displayed.
The Dinig options will Include Name, Location, price range and pictures.
